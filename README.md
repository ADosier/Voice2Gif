# VoiceToGif
Voice to gif is what you think it is; a way to convert voice into gifs

The way this functions is:
=> convert voice to text using the open source machine learning library Deep Speech
=> processes the text into meaningful key words
=> inputs some of those key words into a gif search API
=> displays the gif full screen
